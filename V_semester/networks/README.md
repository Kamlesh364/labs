# SPELLcast

Audio streaming server similar to Shoutcast and Icecast developed for computer network class. The intent of this project is to learn about computer networks, not to create another Icecast clone that could be used in real life situations.

## FEATURES:
  * supports mp3 file streaming 
  * supports both IPv4 and IPv6
  * supports ICY (SHOUTcast protocol). Do not confuse this with Icecast protocol which is slightly different. 
  * multiple broadcasts (sources) using mountpoints
  * logging 

## DESCRIPTION:

#### SOURCE
generates media content in encoded bitstream 

#### SERVER
multiplexes stream sent from SOURCE and distributes it to clients that request for it

#### CLIENT

### PROTOCOLS

#### SOURCE-SERVER PROTOCOL
#### CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL

  * Steam is considered to be infinite meaning that content lenght is not known
  * A sessions ends when clients closes the connection

 
## Using vlc as source 

    cvlc -vvv ~/Desktop/Dimdoz_JungleXSelectaH_VibeSteppazVol6.mp3 --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3, ab=96, channels=2, samplerate=44100}:std{access=shout{mp3=1,bitrate=96, samplerate=44100, channels=2,name='name',genre='all'}, mux=raw, dst=source:vlcas@127.0.0.1:8001/test1}'

 streams file Dimdoz_JungleXSelectaH_VibeSteppazVol6.mp3 to SPELLcast (or any other *cast server) located on localhost on port 8001 using 'test1' as a mountpoint
