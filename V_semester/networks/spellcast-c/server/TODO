1. Handling ICY and HTTP protocols

3. Comment functions
4. testing for memleaks
5. fd_set and clients are somewhat redundant : need some better data structures

6. abstract protocol parsing 
8. when client connects to server without mountpoint, server should randomly select source to which it should connect to
9. protocol parsing -> parse everythin to lower and then compare
10. Clean disconnect routine -> we don't no srv
11. ansi c
12. move all FD_SET to register methods -> will be easier for everyone
