1.
   Use ruby idioms
   at least 50 rSpec tests : 40 for specific domain + 10 for common components
   5 matchers used
   2 custom matchers 
   Entity classes must be 100% covered with tests
   user interface must be decoupled from business logic
   No Rails :(
   Persistent state

2. Entity classes must be refactored to ActiveRecord, tests should be refactored as well with least possible loss of functionality => 
"spec titles should remain the same"
  At least 2 stubs and 2 mocks :  example: http://mocha.rubyforge.org/
  ActiveRecord features:
    validation http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html
    assocations http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html
    etc..

  Use one of many possible solutions to automatically insert test data. Fixtures :  http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html
  No UI needed
